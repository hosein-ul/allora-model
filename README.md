# allora-model-forge-topic_69

This repository provides a lightweight reference for running an Allora network worker focused on topic 69 (24-hour BTC price prediction). 

- The `worker.py` script walks through preparing a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 server, training a baseline model, and keeping the worker online with simple automation hints. Use it as a quick guide to replicate the setup or adapt it for your own Allora experiments.
